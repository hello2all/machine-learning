## Proposal

### Domain Background
Recent advancement in autonomous vehicles has shown the once fictional technology is gradually becoming reality in the near future. In the foreseeable future, vehicles of various automation levels will coexist on the road. Thus it is crucial for automated driving machines able to recognise and interpret the meaning of traffic signs and follow traffic rules. Traffic sign recognition topics have been relatively well studied in research, notable publications include [[1]](http://orff.uc3m.es/bitstream/handle/10016/7089/traffic_escalera_IVC_2003_ps.pdf?sequence=1) which used nerual network to classify signs; and [[2]](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.63.283&rep=rep1&type=pdf) uses pattern matching; with the advances in convolutional nerual network, [[3]](http://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/31151276/sermanet-ijcnn-11.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAIWOWYYGZ2Y53UL3A&Expires=1488356415&Signature=mNLKx2u9LSrucELj%2FDcqC598MVY%3D&response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3DTraffic_Sign_Recognition_with_Multi-Scal.pdf) is able to achieve human level accuracy using muti-scale convolutional nerual network.

### Problem Statement
For this multi-class classification problem, an automatic traffic sign recognition system will be built to categorize various traffic sign images. A deep convolutional neural network will be trained on various traffic sign images, its performance should exceed human accuracy to provide the highest safety for autonomous vehicles.

### Datasets and Inputs
[GTSRB [4]](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=news) is a multi-class, single-image dataset consists of 50,000+ traffic sign images with 40 classes collected in Germany. Some of the images smaples are shown below.

The system to be built in this project will use the images in the dataset as input, and the class category as output. Data can be downloaded from the official website [http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset). These large amount of images are collect in real life, thus very suitable to be used as training data for the learning model.
### Solution Statement
The system will use the state of art convolutional nerual network with many advanced techniques include but not limited to image augmentation, image preprocessing, multi-scale convolutional nerual network, etc. Furthermore, other advanced methods such as spatial transformer network [[12]](http://papers.nips.cc/paper/5854-spatial-transformer-networks.pdf) will be experimented to achieve the best performance. The final accuracy of the model will be tested on the unseen test dataset percentage wise. 

### Benchmark Model
Many prior researches have been conducted on this dataset. The best published results are listed in the table below.
